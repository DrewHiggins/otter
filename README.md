Otter
=====
Otter is a member management web application I built for an honors fraternity
I belonged to during my time at Penn State University, named after our chapter's
official mascot. It stores information on membership status, rush class
information, and big/little brother family trees.

Previously, this information was stored in a set of Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets, but I was able to dump the data into this application by
converting the spreadsheets to CSVs, then applying a custom parser to load it
into Rail's SQL database.
